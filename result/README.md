# Experimental Results

The experimental result data (result_graph1, result_graph2, result_graph3, result_graph4) can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PjcpbunFgyB159yYvThLv64Rz8XP-N7I?usp=drive_link) and placed in this folder. By running the corresponding Python scripts, you will be able to generate the same graphs as presented in the paper.

- **result_graph1**: Results for the Base Cluster
- **result_graph2**: Results for the High Bandwidth Cluster
- **result_graph3**: Results for the High Performance Cluster
- **result_graph4**: Results for the Large Cluster

## Python Scripts

The following Python scripts generate various graphs related to the experimental results:

- **allocateTime.py**: Outputs a graph showing the time required for RAMPA allocation.
- **allocatedservices.py**: Outputs a graph comparing the number of services that successfully meet performance requirements in RAMPA versus comparison methods.
- **partitioning.py**: Outputs a graph displaying the distribution of model partitioning in RAMPA.
- **responseTime.py**: Outputs a graph comparing the execution times of allocated services between RAMPA and comparison methods.
- **throughput.py**: Outputs a graph comparing the throughput of allocated services between RAMPA and comparison methods.
