## パラメータ設定
The following parameters are used to configure the deep learning model:

- **ID:** The unique identifier for the model.
- **OPE:** The total number of operations in the model.
- **FLOPS:** The number of Floating Point Operations per Second (FLOPs) for each operation in the model (in G FLOPs).
- **MEM:** The memory consumption (in MB) for each operation in the model.
- **OUT:** The output data size (in MB) generated by each operation in the model.
- **TIME:** The performance requirement for the execution time.
- **THROUGH:** The performance requirement for the throughput.
